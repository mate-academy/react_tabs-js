# React Tabs (JS)

Implement the `Tabs` component that renders several tabs and allows the user to switch between them.

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_tabs)

The `App` should communicate with the `Tabs` component using the following props:

- `tabs` - an array of tab objects to be rendered as `Tabs`;
- `activeTabId` - the `id` of the tab that should be active;
- `onTabSelected` - a callback executed with the `id` of a just selected tab when the user clicks on it.

The `Tabs` component should be stateless (does not have an internal state, only props).

Follow the next requirements to pass the tests:
1. Render tabs in a list (`<ul>`);
2. Each `<li>` should have a `data-cy="Tab"`.
3. The `<li>` of an active tab should have the `is-active` class.
4. If `activeTabId` does not match any object in the `tabs` array, the first one should be active.
5. Add a link with `data-cy="TabLink"` and a `href` to `#tab-id` inside every `<li>` (see the markup).
6. The `Tabs` component should render the content of the active tab in the element with `data-cy="TabContent"`.
7. Call `onTabSelected` only when the user selects a non-active tab.
8. Use the title of the active tab in the `<h1>` of the `App` component in the following format: `Selected tab is Tab 1`.
